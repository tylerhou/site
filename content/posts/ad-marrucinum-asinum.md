Catullus 12  
AD MARRUCINUM ASINUM

Marrucinus, you used your hand  
For joke and wine not well;  
You stole my napkin—but I did  
At first the theft not tell.

Do you think you are clever?

Does it escape you, fool, that deed which is  
As filthy as can be?  
Believe me not? Believe Pollio:  
Your brother—begged me, he:

“O, sir, forgive my brother, please!  
I’ll pay its price in gold,  
His deed was just some accident:  
Good will instead he holds!”

Your brother is of better mold  
(He’s filled with charm and wit!)  
But nonetheless I’ll take no gold,  
No coin, no! Not one bit.

You see, my napkin is quite cheap  
When it’s exchanged for gold,  
But it has sentimentality  
To me, quite strong and old.

Therefore, either:

Expect three thousand syllables  
Penned in poetic form,  
With tales of your great error filled  
My napkin they shall mourn.

Or bring my napkin back to me  
And then I shall forgive.  
Since it holds some reminders true  
Of friends I miss and love.

Yes, Fabullus and Veranius  
Brought it, a gift, to me,  
And loved, like how I once loved them,  
The napkin, it must be.
